This project is using different machine learning methods to test on a real-world medical image dataset. We will be using CNN-based Resnet, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to identify different performances between the traditional classification machine learning methods and deep learning methods. Due to that we are only testing and exploring the difference between CNN-based ResNet and traditional machine learning methods, we have not used any dataset expanding technique such as Image Augmentation.
